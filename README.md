## 1. PyFrag in combination with other programs

The PyFrag program is specially designed to facilitates the study of reaction mechanism in a more efficient and user-friendly way. It automates the process of finding transition states, potential energy surface by using one simple input file. It follows by an activation strain analysis on the energy profile to characterize the feature of the reaction mechanism and gain insights into the overall reaction energies. Moreover, users can have an real-time monitoring of the running process via a webpage which vividly displays the updated data in the form of videos and figures and, if necessary, user can rerun the job immediately from where it stops. In this way, the three respects of computational chemistryâ€“job management, data management and analysis management can all be contained in a framework and thus allow chemists to focus on the interpretation and creation work rather than waste time and energy on the finding and processing of massive data.

## 2. PyFrag installation

Pyfrag can be splited into two part. One part should be installed in local machine, and the other should be put into the remote host machine (for example suppercommuter or cluster that do the heavy compuational jobs). This program relies on some of the following programs.

1. ADF  ()
2. qmflow
3. bokeh
4.
