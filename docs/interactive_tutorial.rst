Basic Usage Tutorial
====================

Usage
-----

User can type pyfrag -h to see all the commands that can be used in this program, which will show: ::

   Usage: pyfrag [-h] [-s] [-x command]  [...]
   -h          : print this information
   -s          : run job quietly
   -x          : start the executable named command
               : command include restart, which restart job
               : restart, which restart a job after it is stoped
               : summary, which summarize all job result after jobs finished
               : default command is pyfrag itself
   The example command is like as follow, in which job.in is job input
   pyfrag job.in
   or
   pyfrag -x restart job.in
   or
   pyfrag -s -x summary job.in

To submit a job, create a directory and generate a input file and run the following command to submit a job. Noted for each job a new directory and a new job name should be given. Donâ€™t put more than one job in one directory, othervise it may cause clash.

``pyfrag job.in``

if your want to know the latest information about your job, just run:

``pyfrag -x summary job.in``

if your change the input file and want to submit it again, just run:

``pyfrag -x restart job.in``


Input example
-------------

A simple job input is as follow, which can be roughtly divided into four section: Job submit information, ADF parameter, PyFrag parameter and geometry parameters, as explained in the comment parts.
More explation about PyFrag part can be found in the following site ::

You might want additional input for different parts of the calculation. Here extra fragment1 and fragment2 indicate the single point calculations for fragment 1 and 2, respectively. Extra complex inserts statements for the fragment analysis calculation. Similarly, the R1 EXTRA, R2 EXTRA, RC EXTRA, TS EXTRA, P EXTRA, IR EXTRA insert statements for R1, R2, RC, TS, P, IRC calculation. These statements will be useful when the parameter set differ for different calculation, in which case the following statements arise ::

   fragment1 EXTRA
   charge 1
   fragment1 EXTRA END

   fragment2 EXTRA
   charge -1
   fragment2 EXTRA END

   complex EXTRA

Result example
--------------
After a job is submited, a website that summarize all information which include a) the converge inforamtion, b)the latest structure in the form of movie, c) the latest energy and coordinate and d) the activation strain analysis (if a job is finished) will pop up. User can decide if the trend of optimization is right or wrong, if necessary, the job can be stoped. After the input is varied, job will be resubmited and resume from where it stoped before.
