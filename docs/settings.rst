The PyFrag program is specially designed to facilitates the study of reaction mechanism in a more efficient and user-friendly way. It is an expansion of a popular program also named by PyFrag in our group. More information can be found in "https://sunxb05.github.io/pyfrag/". It automates the process of finding transition states, potential energy surface by using one simple input file. It follows by an activation strain analysis on the energy profile to characterize the feature of the reaction mechanism and gain insights into the overall reaction energies. Moreover, users can have an real-time monitoring of the running process via a webpage which vividly displays the updated data in
