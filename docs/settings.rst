Motivation
==========
The PyFrag program is specially designed to facilitates the study of reaction mechanism in a more efficient and user-friendly way. It is an expansion of a popular program also named by PyFrag in our group. More information can be found in "https://sunxb05.github.io/pyfrag/". It automates the process of finding transition states, potential energy surface by using one simple input file. It follows by an activation strain analysis on the energy profile to characterize the feature of the reaction mechanism and gain insights into the overall reaction energies. Moreover, users can have an real-time monitoring of the running process via a webpage which vividly displays the updated data in the form of videos and figures and, if necessary, user can rerun the job immediately from where it stops. In this way, the three respects of computational chemistryâ€“job management, data management and analysis management can all be contained in a framework and thus allow chemists to focus on the interpretation and creation work rather than waste time and energy on the finding and processing of massive data.

Description
===========
This library consists of a set of modules written in Python3 to
automate the following tasks:

 1. Input generation.
 2. Handle tasks dependencies (Noodles_).
 3. Advanced molecular manipulation capabilities with (rdkit_).
 4. Numerical data storage and manipulation (HDF5_).
 5. Jobs failure detection and recovery.
 6. Distribution in heterogeneous hardware platforms.

Tutorial and Examples
---------------------
A tutorial written as a jupyter-notebook_ is available from: tutorial-qmflows_. You can
also access direclty more advanced examples_.


Installation
============

- Download miniconda for python3: miniconda_ (also you can install the complete anaconda_ version).

- Install according to: installConda_.

- Create a new virtual environment using the following commands:

  - ``conda create -n qmflows``

- Activate the new virtual environment

  - ``source activate qmflows``

To exit the virtual environment type  ``source deactivate``.


.. _dependecies:

Dependencies installation
-------------------------

- Type in your terminal:

  ``conda activate qmflows``

Using the conda environment the following packages should be installed:


- install rdkit_ using conda:

  - ``conda install -y -q --name qmflows -c rdkit rdkit``

- install HDF5_ using conda:

  - ``conda install -y -q --name qmflows -c anaconda h5py``


.. _installation:

Package installation
--------------------
Finally install the package:

- Update PLAMS_ using pip:
  - ``pip install git+https://github.com/SCM-NV/PLAMS@master#egg=plams-1.2``

- Install **QMFlows** using pip:
  - ``pip install git+https://github.com/SCM-NV/qmflows@master#egg=qmflows-0.3.0``

Now you are ready to use *qmflows*.


  **Notes:**

  - Once the libraries and the virtual environment are installed, you only need to type
    ``conda activate qmflows`` each time that you want to use the software.
